## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

Here‚Äôs how you can set up the Action in your repository:

### 1. Code Review on Every Pull Request

Create a workflow file (e.g., `.github/workflows/code-review.yml`) with the following content:

```yaml
name: 'Code Review'

on: 
  pull_request: # Trigger on pull requests

jobs:
  code-review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      pull-requests: write
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: small3flower/creview@v0.4
        env:
          NODE_OPTIONS: '--experimental-fetch'
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          anthropic_api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
          exclude_files: '*.json, *.md, *.yml' # Optional: Exclude files from the review
```

---

### 2. Trigger Code Review on Labeled Pull Requests

To trigger the review only when a specific label (e.g., `AUTO`) is added to a PR, use the following workflow configuration:

```yaml
name: 'Code Review on Labeled PRs'

on: 
  pull_request:
    types: [labeled] # Trigger when a label is added

jobs:
  code-review:
    if: ${{ contains(github.event.label.name, 'AUTO') }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      pull-requests: write
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: small3flower/creview@v0.4
        env:
          NODE_OPTIONS: '--experimental-fetch'
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          anthropic_api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
          exclude_files: '*.json, *.md, *.yml' # Optional: Exclude files from the review
```
